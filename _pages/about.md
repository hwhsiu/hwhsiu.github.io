The AM-RL focuses on material-based solutions for challenges in infrastructure performance, hazard mitigation, and environmental sustainability. The core of our research lies in the micromechanics-based design of Engineered Cementitious Composites (ECC), which exhibit high ductility and crack control capabilities.

We are particularly interested in developing low-carbon and durable materials by utilizing waste COâ‚‚, aiming to improve long-term performance while contributing to carbon reduction. Our work bridges material science and engineering needs, with an emphasis on practical applications and environmental responsibility.
