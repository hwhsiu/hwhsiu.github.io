# Fall Term 
- **Reinforcement Concrete (鋼筋混凝土學)**, _CIE3009_
    - This course provides a foundational understanding essential for structural designers. It aims to develop a comprehensive understanding of the mechanical behavior of concrete and steel reinforcement, both as individual materials and as integrated components in reinforced concrete members. The course examines the combined structural behavior of reinforced concrete, focusing on stress distribution and failure modes in beams and columns subjected to flexural, shear, and axial loads. Building upon this understanding, the course further explores design methodologies for flexure, shear, and axial force in reinforced concrete beams and columns, grounded in the fundamental mechanics of materials and structural behavior.
- **Advanced Concrete Theory (高等混凝土學)**,_CIE7170_
    - This course offers a comprehensive overview of the fundamental and advanced material properties of concrete. It begins with an introduction to basic material characteristics, followed by an in-depth exploration of cement hydration and microstructural development, as well as the progression of concrete strength over time. Key time-dependent behaviors such as creep and shrinkage in both plain and structural concrete are examined, alongside issues related to durability in service environments. The course also addresses the effects of extreme temperatures, including the design of fire-resistant structural members and the performance of concrete under cryogenic conditions for low-temperature applications. Advanced topics include linear elastic fracture mechanics, covering both stress-based and energy-based approaches, and the use of high-performance concrete materials. The course concludes with an introduction to the micromechanics of fibrous composites, focusing on their elastic properties, stress-strain behavior, and tensile strength, particularly in fiber-reinforced concrete systems.

# Spring Term
- **Engineering Material (工程材料學)**, _CIE2019_
    - This course offers students the ability to understand a broad range of materials and their properties as they pertain to civil engineering construction and structural design. Students also gain the aptitude to perform concrete mix design, the measurement of mechanical and physical properties of materials, and an appreciation of the impacts of construction materials on the environment.  
    Modality: Hybrid in-person flip classroom.
- **Structural Theory (結構學一)**, _CIE3010_
    - This course teaches how to analyze basic structures like beams, trusses, and rigid frames. It aims to solve problems related to internal force and displacement at specific points within these structures.
